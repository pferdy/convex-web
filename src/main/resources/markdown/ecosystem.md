## Builders

If you are looking for the best platform to build your decentralised application or use case, you are at the right place! We support all innovators and entrepreneurs building on top of the Convex platform, who may also be eligible to receive grants from the Convex Foundation

## Community

We are a diverse, international, open community and welcome anyone who wants to participate in the Convex ecosystem. Discussions happen primarily on the [Convex Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fsnCxEM) and technology development is fully open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Convex-Dev).

## Investors

Prior to the main network launch, we will not sell Convex Coins to retail investors. Institutional investors willing and able to make a substantial investment in Convex are welcome to contact us at [info@convex.world](mailto:info@convex.world).
